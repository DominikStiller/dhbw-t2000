make into mature product

Predictive scheduler using times for task to make scheduling more intelligent, as idea for future work
Keep trained model and update it every n new entries to skip loading history time for every task
Check currently known best configurations and see if SLA is already met before actually starting autotuning
Automatically set up autotuning infrastructure
