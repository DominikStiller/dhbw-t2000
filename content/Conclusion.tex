Describe results
Only used scheduler for TVM, but should work for TC as well because it also has stage dependencies
Enabled large-scale autotuning with only small sacrifices in autotuning time, thesis holds for our limited set of tests

\section{Future Work}
More intelligent scheduler algorithm
Get rid of tracker and let scheduler assign servers

After best approach is found from prototype, make into mature product to enable real-time DL applications for everybody
