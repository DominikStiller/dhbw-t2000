Machine learning
Consists of training and inference
\section{Artificial Neural Networks}
general structure with layers
layers: fully-connected, batch norm
basically a function mapping from input (image, text, data) to result (e.g. classification)
trend towards more layers to create more complex function which are more powerful
many layers: deep neural network
\section{Convolutional Neural Networks}
more layers: pooling and convolutions
important for computer vision

\section{Computation Graph Representation}
In its essence, machine learning is a series of calculations, mostly on matrices and vectors
While neural network models consist of a series of layers, machine learning frameworks usually represent them in a computation graph.
The computation graph's first vertex is the input node, followed by a number of tensor operators (convolutions, pooling) and finally an output node.
The edges describes how data flows between the vertices.
