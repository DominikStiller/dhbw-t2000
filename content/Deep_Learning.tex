Machine learning
Consists of training and inference
\section{Artificial Neural Networks}
general structure with layers
layers: fully-connected, batch norm
basically a function mapping from input (image, text, data) to result (e.g. classification)
trend towards more layers to create more complex function which are more powerful
many layers: deep neural network
\section{Convolutional Neural Networks}
more layers: pooling and convolutions
important for computer vision

\section{Computation Graph Representation}
in essence just a lot of calculations
calculations can be represented in computation graph
graph describes which calculations need to be done and stays the same
tensor operators implement convolutions, pooling and need to be optimized for accelerator hardware
