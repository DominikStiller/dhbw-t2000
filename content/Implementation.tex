\section{Design Principles}
prototype
touch TVM code as little as possible
build on SimpleTVM
should work with a variable number of clients
\section{Scheduler Design}
interleaving while keeping dependencies
agnostic of stages, necessity for call next/is done methdods
allows for multiple strategies
\section{Approaches}
In process vs RPC
\section{RPC}
schedulers and clients
describe endpoints
